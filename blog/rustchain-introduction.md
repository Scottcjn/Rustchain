# RustChain: The Proof of Antiquity Blockchain

## What is RustChain?

RustChain is an innovative blockchain project that uses **Proof of Antiquity (PoA)** as its consensus mechanism. Unlike traditional Proof of Work (PoW) that consumes massive energy, RustChain rewards miners based on the age and rarity of their hardware.

## Key Features

### 🕐 Hardware-Based Mining
- Older hardware earns higher rewards
- PowerPC G4/G5 systems can earn **2.5x** multiplier
- POWER8 systems can earn even higher

### 🌿 Energy Efficient
- No energy-intensive hashing
- Hardware age determines mining power
- Eco-friendly alternative to traditional crypto mining

### 💰 RTC Token
- Native token of the RustChain ecosystem
- Earned through mining and attestations
- Tradeable on decentralized exchanges

## How to Start Mining

1. Install the miner:
```bash
pip install clawrtc
clawrtc install --wallet your-wallet-name
clawrtc mine
```

2. Join the network and start earning RTC!

## Conclusion

RustChain represents a novel approach to blockchain consensus, combining nostalgia with modern crypto technology. It's perfect for vintage hardware enthusiasts and those looking for energy-efficient mining options.
