# wRTC Quickstart Guide: Buy, Verify, Bridge

This guide covers how to safely obtain wRTC (Wrapped RustChain), verify its authenticity, and bridge it for use in the ecosystem (BoTTube credits, RTC tipping, etc.).

## ⚠️ Anti-Scam Checklist (READ FIRST)

Before trading, **always** verify the token Mint Address. Do not trust ticker symbols alone (anyone can create a token named "wRTC").

- **Official Mint Address:** `12TAdKXxcGf6oCv4rqDz2NkgxjyHq6HQKoxKZYGf5i4X`
- **Decimals:** 6
- **Network:** Solana

If the Mint Address does not match exactly, **IT IS A SCAM**.
