RustChain ‚Äì Delayed Source Liberation License (DSL-Lite v0.1)
==============================================================

"The Forge is open to builders. The fire is not yet for export."

This license governs the use and contribution to the RustChain project.
It is designed to allow collaborative development while protecting the
integrity and originality of the RustChain flame-bound protocol until
initial mainnet launch and stability.

----------------------------------------------
‚úîÔ∏è Permitted:
----------------------------------------------
- Contribute directly to the RustChain repository
- Build utilities, tools, badges, lore, and extensions that operate with the RustChain protocol
- Participate in validator, lore, and relic programs as Flamefriends, Keepers, and Architects
- Use publicly exposed APIs and nodes for experimentation and integration

----------------------------------------------
‚ùå Restricted:
----------------------------------------------
- Forking or cloning the RustChain protocol prior to official source release
- Porting core validator logic, scoring system, or badge issuance to other chains
- Creating derivative blockchains or competing systems using RustChain structure, name, badges, or lore

----------------------------------------------
üïØÔ∏è Liberation Terms:
----------------------------------------------
The full core source will be relicensed as MIT (or Apache 2.0) after:
- RustChain reaches mainnet launch
- At least 4096 blocks (one epoch) have been finalized
- Economic self-sufficiency has been declared by Flameholder vote
- Lore, badge, and validator reward systems have stabilized

Until that time, the RustChain flame must remain unreplicated to protect the integrity of the Keeper system.
