# 🧱 RustChain: Proof-of-Antiquity Blockchain

> “Every relic has a story. Every block, a tribute.”  
> — *RustChain: Make Mining Meaningful Again.*

RustChain is a preservation-first blockchain powered by **Proof-of-Antiquity (PoA)**. We reward authentic old machines — not for speed, but for survival.

## 🚀 Core Features

- 🧠 **PoA:** Block scoring based on BIOS date, entropy lag, and hardware rarity
- 🛠️ **Validator toolkit in Python**
- 🏷️ **NFT Badge System** ("DOS WiFi Alchemist", "QuickBasic Listener", "Bondi G3 Flamekeeper")
- 🧩 **Lightweight:** Forge blocks on DOS, macOS 9, or even Win95

## ⚡ Quick Start - Start Mining in 60 Seconds

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Scottcjn/Rustchain/main/install.sh | bash
```

**That's it.** The installer:
- Auto-detects your platform (Linux, macOS, PPC, POWER8)
- Downloads the correct miner
- Configures your wallet
- Connects to the network

**Supported Hardware:**
| Platform | Antiquity Multiplier |
|----------|---------------------|
| PowerPC G4 | 2.5x |
| PowerPC G5 | 2.0x |
| IBM POWER8 | 1.5x |
| Apple Silicon | 1.2x |
| Modern x86_64 | 1.0x |

*Yes, your old G4 Mac earns MORE than a modern PC. That's the point.*
