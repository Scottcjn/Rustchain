# 🔩 RustChain

**Preserve the Forgotten. Reward the Relic.**

RustChain is a novel blockchain protocol built on **Proof-of-Antiquity (PoA)** — rewarding miners for **hardware age**, **entropy resistance**, and **authentic computing heritage**. It’s more than a ledger: it’s a digital museum empowered by code.
