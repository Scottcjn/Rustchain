# 🧱 RustChain: Proof-of-Antiquity Blockchain

> “Every relic has a story. Every block, a tribute.”  
> — *RustChain: Make Mining Meaningful Again.*

RustChain is a preservation-first blockchain powered by **Proof-of-Antiquity (PoA)**. We reward authentic old machines — not for speed, but for survival.

## 🚀 Core Features

- 🧠 **PoA:** Block scoring based on BIOS date, entropy lag, and hardware rarity
- 🛠️ **Validator toolkit in Python**
- 🏷️ **NFT Badge System** (“DOS WiFi Alchemist”, “QuickBasic Listener”, “Bondi G3 Flamekeeper”)
- 🧩 **Lightweight:** Forge blocks on DOS, macOS 9, or even Win95

## 📄 Quick Links
